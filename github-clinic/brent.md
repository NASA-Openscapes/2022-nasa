# Physical Oceaongraphy Project - High Resolution Ocean Surface Fluxes

Project Goals:
1. Extend variational retrievals from *passive* microwave radiometers to include near-surface air humidities and temperature in addition to surface wind speed.
2. Increase resolution of air-sea flux product to 12.5km
3. Create product that uses all **PMM-era** microwave imagers

Example of 25km SeaFlux-V3 dataset:
